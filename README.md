# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The objective of this project was to take the raw dataset "ecommerce", understand, clean and transform the data - making sure to address quality assurance issues within pgAdmin, and to use the resulting cleaned data in understanding and gaining insight into various questions surrounding this particular ecommerce business.

## Process
### (Process overview, code and specific relational below)
1. Load raw data from csv files into pgAdmin
2. Understand data columns, data types and how data relates to each other in the raw data (also understanding the questions that are required and which datas will be needed)
3. Recreate new tables that are more useful for analytics
4. Load, join and clean data into the new tables (while excluding not useful data)
5. Examine the new database and check for QA
6. Query the data and draw conclusions

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges
