 **Question 1: Which cities and countries have the highest level of transaction revenues on the site?**

SQL Queries:

SELECT country, COUNT(revenue)
FROM visitortransactions
GROUP BY country
HAVING count(revenue) > 0
ORDER BY COUNT(revenue) DESC

SELECT country, SUM(revenue)
FROM visitortransactions
GROUP BY country
HAVING SUM(revenue) > 0
ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC

SELECT city, COUNT(revenue)
FROM visitortransactions
GROUP BY city
HAVING count(revenue) > 0
ORDER BY COUNT(revenue) DESC

SELECT city, SUM(revenue)
FROM visitortransactions
GROUP BY city
HAVING SUM(revenue) > 0
ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC

Answer:

In terms of country, the United States leads transactions both in the number of transactions and the total revenue generated by a wide margin. This was determined by the above queries 1 and 2. The runners up are Canada and Isreal in both number of transactions and total revenue generated.

In terms of cities, out of the top 10 cities, 9 are located within the United States and 5 of these cities are from the State of California. The top 3 cities in terms of number of transactions and total revenue generated are New York, Sunnyvale and Mountain View. These results were found with queries 3 and 4.




**Question 2: What is the average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?**

SQL Queries:

SELECT country, AVG(quantity)
FROM visitortransactions
GROUP BY country
HAVING AVG(quantity) is not null
ORDER BY AVG(quantity) DESC

SELECT * 
FROM visitortransactions
WHERE 	country = 'Spain' AND
		revenue is not null

SELECT city, AVG(quantity)
FROM visitortransactions
GROUP BY city
HAVING AVG(quantity) is not null
ORDER BY AVG(quantity) DESC

SELECT * 
FROM visitortransactions
WHERE 	city = 'Madrid' AND
		revenue is not null
  
Answer:

By country, Spain has the highest average number of products ordered in their transactions. This is due to an outlier that can be confirmed with query #2. However, as expected, disregarding the outlier, the United States have the next highest average number of products that are ordered from visitors. This is followed again by Canada and Israel. (query #1)

Sorting by city, (query #3) we can see that Atlanta leads the highest number of average products ordered. Followed by Sunnyvale, Madrid and Chicago where Madrid is another single outlier (query #4)
